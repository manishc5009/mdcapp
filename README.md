# 📊 MDC Application

MDC Application is a data processing web platform built with **React.js** and **Node.js**, integrated with **Azure Storage** and **Databricks** to automate Excel-based workflows. Users can upload Excel files, trigger Databricks notebooks based on file context, and download the processed output with ease.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload Excel files through a simple UI
- ☁️ Automatically uploads files to Azure Storage
- 🔍 Identifies matching Databricks notebooks for the uploaded file
- ⚙️ Triggers execution of related Databricks notebooks
- 📥 Returns processed results for user download
- 🧠 Handles data workflow automation with cloud scalability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer        | Technology          |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Frontend     | React.js            |
| Backend      | Node.js (Express)   |
| Cloud Storage| Azure Blob Storage  |
| Processing   | Azure Databricks    |
| File Format  | Excel (.xlsx)       |

---


## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- Azure Storage Account
- Azure Databricks Workspace
- Databricks Token (for API access)



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
